    "instruction": "What is the difference between DOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluid?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "DOT 3 and DOT 4 are brake fluid specifications. DOT 4 has higher boiling point (446°F vs 401°F), better performance in high-heat situations, and absorbs moisture slower. However, DOT 4 is more expensive and can damage paint. Always use the type specified in your owner's manual - mixing types or using wrong type can cause brake failure. Brake fluid should be changed every 2-3 years.",

    "instruction": "What is the difference between synthetic and conventional oil?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Synthetic oil is chemically engineered to provide better protection and performance than conventional oil. It flows better in cold temperatures, resists breakdown at high temperatures, and can last longer between changes. Conventional oil is derived directly from crude oil. Synthetic oil is more expensive but offers superior engine protection, especially in extreme conditions. Many modern vehicles require synthetic oil.",

    "instruction": "What should I check before a long road trip?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Before long trip: check tire pressure and tread depth, inspect tires for damage, check all fluid levels (oil, coolant, brake, transmission, power steering), test battery, check lights (headlights, brake lights, turn signals), inspect belts and hoses, ensure spare tire is inflated, pack emergency kit (jumper cables, tools, first aid), and have recent oil change if due. Consider professional inspection if trip is very long.",
