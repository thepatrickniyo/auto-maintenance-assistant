    "instruction": "What is a CVT transmission and how do I maintain it?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) uses belts and pulleys instead of gears for seamless acceleration. Maintenance: change CVT fluid every 30,000-60,000 miles (check manual), avoid aggressive towing, don't 'neutral drop', and have it serviced by qualified technicians. CVT fluid is specific - never use regular ATF. Signs of problems: slipping, jerking, or whining noises. CVTs require specialized service.",

    "instruction": "How often should I rotate my tires?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Tires should be rotated every 5,000 to 8,000 miles, or according to your vehicle's maintenance schedule. Tire rotation helps ensure even wear across all tires, extending their lifespan and improving handling. The rotation pattern depends on whether your vehicle is front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive. Some vehicles have directional tires that can only rotate front-to-back.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Get your alignment checked if you notice: uneven tire wear, vehicle pulling to one side, steering wheel off-center, or after hitting a pothole or curb. Most manufacturers recommend checking alignment every 2-3 years or 20,000-30,000 miles. Proper alignment improves tire life, fuel efficiency, and handling. It's relatively inexpensive and quick to fix.",

    "instruction": "What is the difference between synthetic and conventional oil?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Synthetic oil is chemically engineered to provide better protection and performance than conventional oil. It flows better in cold temperatures, resists breakdown at high temperatures, and can last longer between changes. Conventional oil is derived directly from crude oil. Synthetic oil is more expensive but offers superior engine protection, especially in extreme conditions. Many modern vehicles require synthetic oil.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "The air filter should typically be replaced every 12,000 to 15,000 miles, or once a year. However, if you drive in dusty conditions, you may need to replace it more frequently. A dirty air filter reduces fuel efficiency and engine performance. You can check it visually - if it looks dirty or clogged, replace it. Air filters are inexpensive and easy to replace yourself.",

    "output": "If your car won't start, check these common causes: 1) Dead battery (try jump-starting), 2) Empty gas tank, 3) Faulty starter (clicking sound), 4) Ignition switch issues, 5) Fuel pump problems (no sound when turning key), 6) Security system preventing start. Start with the simplest checks first. If battery is good and you hear the engine trying to turn over, it's likely a fuel or ignition issue requiring professional diagnosis.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "AWD (All-Wheel Drive) automatically distributes power to all wheels and is always engaged, providing better traction in various conditions. 4WD (Four-Wheel Drive) can be manually engaged/disengaged and is designed for off-road use and low-speed traction. AWD is better for on-road performance and handling, while 4WD excels in off-road situations. AWD systems are more complex and can be more expensive to maintain.",

    "instruction": "What causes engine knocking and how do I fix it?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Engine knocking (pinging) is caused by premature fuel ignition in the cylinder. Common causes: using lower octane fuel than required, carbon buildup, incorrect ignition timing, or engine overheating. Solutions: use higher octane fuel, clean carbon deposits, check timing, ensure proper cooling. Persistent knocking can damage pistons and should be addressed immediately. Modern engines have knock sensors that adjust timing automatically.",

Most vehicles require timing belt replacement every 60,000 to 100,000 miles (check your owner's manual). If a timing belt breaks, it can cause catastrophic engine damage. Some vehicles use timing chains which typically last longer. This is a critical maintenance item that shouldn't be ignored.",

It could be something minor like a loose gas cap or something more serious like an engine misfire. You should have your vehicle diagnosed by a mechanic or use an OBD-II scanner to read the error codes. Don't ignore it - even minor issues can lead to expensive repairs if left unchecked.",

Check when tires are cold (before driving) for accurate readings. Most passenger cars require 30-35 PSI.",

Common causes: failing oxygen sensors, exhaust leaks, damaged catalytic converter, or engine misfires causing unburned fuel. Start by checking for exhaust leaks, then test oxygen sensors. If sensors are good, the catalytic converter likely needs replacement. This code won't cause immediate problems but will fail emissions tests.",
